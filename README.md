## Problem Statement

SM’s and unit leaders need an accessible system to update and track admin tasks and requirements. SM’s are currently forced to navigate many complicated and constantly changing online systems to acquire this information, which leads to poor tracking.  PERSTAT strives to be an optional, open-source application that units can use as an alternative method of tracking all relevant admin items.
